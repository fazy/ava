This text is about the secrets of parenting that nobody tells you about. It covers topics such as how older parents don't remember the early days, how babies find it harder to sleep when they're tired, how they hate it when you wipe their nose, how they are master manipulators, how you appreciate the simplest pleasures in life once you lose them, how babies fart, how teething is painful and how babies don't like to look at the person holding them. Despite all of these things, the author still loves their baby and enjoys the joy and love they bring into their lives.
