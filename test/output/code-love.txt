Verse 1:
I was running a program, to move a file and keep it safe
When I found out I had to copy it over in this new place
So I searched my folder and I found the file I need
But I knew I had to back it up before I succeeded

Chorus:
And I know that when I'm with you, I'm safe and sound
I can go beyond the boundaries and I won't be found
No matter what I do, don't let me forget
That I'm so lucky to have you and I won't forget

Verse 2:
I set my script in motion, and it worked like a charm
My program ran exactly as I feared it wouldn't
But I was determined, I had to get this done
So I kept on going, and I didn't run

Chorus:
And I know that when I'm with you, I'm safe and sound
I can go beyond the boundaries and I won't be found
No matter what I do, don't let me forget
That I'm so lucky to have you and I won't forget

Bridge:
My backup worked, I can see the success I found
And I know that I'm so lucky 'cause I have you around
No matter where I go, I'll never be lost
You're my one and only, my love at its most

Chorus:
And I know that when I'm with you, I'm safe and sound
I can go beyond the boundaries and I won't be found
No matter what I do, don't let me forget
That I'm so lucky to have you and I won't forget
