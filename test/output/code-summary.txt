This code is used to backup virtual machines (VMs) stored in the "Parallels" folder of the user's computer to a destination folder. It first checks if both the source and destination folders exist, then uses the "find" command to search for all directories with the ".pvm" extension. For each of these directories, it creates a local archive of the VM and copies it to the destination folder, renaming any existing backups.
