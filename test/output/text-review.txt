Spelling or grammatical errors: "eludes them" should be "eludes it"
- Repetitive use of the same words: "early days" is used twice
- Redundant ideas: "It goes in phases of course" is redundant as the sentence already implies that it goes in phases
- Text that is hard to understand: "Bum on a chair, teething despair; bum in the air thatâ€™s fair" is difficult to understand.
