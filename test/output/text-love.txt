Chorus:
Life with a baby ain't easy, but so worth it in the end
Love and joy will fill your heart, when you look at them

Verse 1:
Some secrets won't be shared, but that won't stop us here
We never expected some of the things we'd encounter this year
From sleepless nights to endless cries, our patience put to the test
But when they smile and look at us, our love knows no rest

Chorus:
Life with a baby ain't easy, but so worth it in the end
Love and joy will fill your heart, when you look at them

Verse 2:
No time for time for movies or dinners out we planned
But those simple moments together, those times make us stand
Babysitting with a smile or a fart, or their eyes so sweet
Everyday is new and different, our journey's no retreat

Chorus:
Life with a baby ain't easy, but so worth it in the end
Love and joy will fill your heart, when you look at them

Verse 3:
With teeth that'll hurt and cries that'll make you want to run
We will stay and hold them close and comfort them as one
We'll do whatever it takes, even if it's hard
For these tiny humans we have, we'll be their guardian stars

Chorus:
Life with a baby ain't easy, but so worth it in the end
Love and joy will fill your heart, when you look at them
