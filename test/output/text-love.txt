Verse 1:
It's hard to believe that we have a little one,
To love and care for, so small and so fun.
But they don't tell you all the craziness that comes,
From the sleepless nights and all the fuss.

Chorus:
Every day I'm in awe of your love,
No matter the chaos, you make it all smooth.
Through all of the madness, you're still my one,
My baby girl there's nothing like your love.

Verse 2:
They don't tell you that when they're tired,
Sleeping will be the last thing desired.
The cries, the smelly farts, it's all on the agenda,
You just gotta hold on through it all and never surrender.

Chorus:
Every day I'm in awe of your love,
No matter the chaos, you make it all smooth.
Through all of the madness, you're still my one,
My baby girl there's nothing like your love.

Verse 3:
We can't take a break, not even for lunch,
But when I see your smile, I know it's worth the punch.
The teething days and sleepless nights soon will pass,
Your love is forever and it will always last.

Chorus:
Every day I'm in awe of your love,
No matter the chaos, you make it all smooth.
Through all of the madness, you're still my one,
My baby girl there's nothing like your love.
