It covers topics such as how parents with older children don't remember the early days, how babies find it harder to sleep when they're tired, how babies hate it when you wipe their nose, how they are master manipulators, how you will appreciate the simplest pleasures in life once you lose them, how everything you learn quickly goes out of date, how babies fart, how teeth are a cruel joke, how babies don't like to look at the person holding them, and how despite all of the difficulties, babies bring joy and love into our lives.
